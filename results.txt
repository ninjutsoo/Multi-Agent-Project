increased seizures and confusion major surgical or invasive procedure lumbar puntures intubation, sedation, followed by extubation history of present illness this is a 66 year old man with a history of absence seizures since the age of 10, who now is brought in by his family because of frequent seizures. the pt has a combination of doctor last name 11332 mal and grand mal seizures, the frequency of which that cannot quantify for me accurately. the family says that his last big seizure by which they mean grand mal, occurred 731. he had to be hospitalized once for frequent seizures, over 40 years ago but none since then, his wife tells me. his neurologist is dr. last name stitle 1809 at hospital3 1810. he apparently has many doctor last name 11332 mal seizures that are characterized by just sitting there, or turning his head to one direction and his eyes rolling up but again they are unable to quantify for me exactly how many these are because they are so brief and apparently subtle in their opinion. they do say that he does have them with some regularity. today he apparently started to have several seizures this morning at about 1130am in the kitchen and since then has had more than usual but again they cannot quantify how many. they believe his thinking and talking are normal in between and they brought him to the ed with vomiting and a headache earlier this evening. his daughter brought him into the name ni  and was present until 11pm. she states that he was talking to her and seemed himself when she left. the ed nurse taking care of him however, had noted that about every hour or so at least, he would turn his head toward the left with eyes deviated left conjugately with no responsiveness. it is not clear how long each episode lasted but in my presence they seem to last about 30 seconds each. he has been confused while here in the ed according to nursing but was talking more spontaneously earlier. prior to my arrival he has gotten 4mg ativan total for at least two distinct episodes. currently he is continuing to have the head turning activity every 34 minutes despite 2 more mg ativan and the running of a dilantin drip for the past 10 minutes at the rate of 1ghr. the resolution of each event is characterized by eyes returning to midline, alerting to the examiners voice and intermittently being able to follow commands. past medical history 1. skin cancer removed last week 2. per dr last name stitle 17127 name stitle 1809 of chb pt has had lifelong ho absence sz lasting 66 sec several times a day, controlled for years on diamox and vpa. in

regular long standing job where he has to maintain alertness and has been given ritalin for narcopleptic symptoms. in addition, 1 mo ago pt had a gtc after a drinking binge and has a strong etoh hx. lfts have been normal, no signs of korsakoff, and neurologist has informed pmd of the etoh hx and dced vpa given etoh hx. current sz managed on diamox and ltg. social history married, worked as a

icu after being intubated and sedated to control increasing seizures in the er. there was no respiratory compromise leading to the intubation. in the icu, pt was taken off sedating medications and was alert enough to be extubated after about 2 days. his csf was remarkable for pleio and lymphocytosis see labs as well as last name lf , first name3 lf  we started antibiotics and acyclovir. the patient was quite stable in the icu  did not require pressors, but was started on his home doses of antiepileptics. after his cultures came back negative, his antibiotics were discontinued. the hsv pcr came back negative today 21461021, at which point we stopped his acyclovir. thoughout his hospital stay, the patient has had very interesting neurologic findings on his mental status exams. he exhibits poor judgement, poor naming of animals in one minute, disorientation, decreased short term memory, and overall seems to have poor mental functioning given his history of being a draftsman. at one point the patient dressed and left the hospital and was found by one of our medical students outside the hospital, confused and disoriented. we then installed a sitter in his room. the patient otherwise has improved on his mental status exam. we do not feel that he has any infection that we can specifically identify but that he most likely had a viral encephalomeningitis pending viral cultures and eastern equine and overall improving clinical picture. he will need to be watched at home until he is functioning at baseline. medications on admission lamictal 225mg po qd diamox 250 po

 admission date 2108717 discharge date 210885 service this is an 80 yearold female with multiple complex medical problems who presented with metastatic gastric cancer, status post ziloda and aronest due the friday following admission on 2108717. she presents for admission on the 12th with complaints of increased heart rate, feeling hot and cold, though unsure if she is febrile over the past three days, as well as the feeling of head fullness and weakness. she has a one year history of atrial fibrillation, but cannot cardiovert secondary to no anticoagulation. also planned for the thursday following admission is a ureteral right stent for hydronephrosis. she had a left stent placed one months prior to this admission due to external compression for lymphadenopathy and radiation in the past. in preparation for this procedure she was off her normal 81 mg of aspirin per day. she also has a history of hard to treat urinary tract infections. in the emergency department the patient was hypotensive. she was asymptomatic but they titrated down her metoprolol. she got 10 mg of diltiazem and she got fluids in the emergency room. she had a temperature to 103 following cultures. past medical history 1 metastatic cancer from gastroesophageal junction diagnosed 72107, locally advanced, status post three months of ziloda, biweekly aronest injections, weekly taxol cycle 3. 2 external compression of ureters bilaterally, status post lateral stent with right hydronephrosis awaiting stent. 3 remote history of aneurysmintracranial bleed. has been on phenobarb for atrial fibrillation times one year refractory to cardioversion and cannot anticoagulate. she has a remote history of gastrointestinal bleeding, gastroesophageal reflux disease, hypothyroidism, coronary artery disease, status post old inferior posterior myocardial infarction with inducible ischemia, history of orthostatic hypotension. allergies questionable allergy to aspirin. history of allergies to penicillin, sulfa drugs and dilantin. medications phenobarbital 30 mg q.h.s., fentanyl 25 mcg q 72 hours, aspirin 81 mg, lipitor 40 mg q.d., metoprolol 12.5 b.i.d., multivitamin, milontin 50 mcg q.d., prozac. physical examination temperature was 99.4, with maximum temperature of 103, blood pressure 11269, heart rate 118 to 140, 97 percent on room air. general elderly, in no apparent distress. head, eyes, ears, nose and throat pupils equal, round, reactive to light, extraocular movements intact. mucous membranes dry. no jugular venous distention. neck supple. chest portacath on right. crackles in left

6.3,, hematocrit of 30.7, platelets of 319, inr of 1.3. chest xray is stable, cardiomegaly, no congestive heart failure, no infiltrate. cta without pulmonary embolus. urine cultures and blood cultures are pending. hospital course patient was determined to be in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate, unable to be anticoagulated due to history of aneurysm. patient was then initiated on diltiazem for rate control. during this time patient went for her right ureteral stent placement by interventional radiology, at which point the first two attempts failed. following the attempt there was a large hematoma. patient had a hematocrit drop from 30 to 25, at which point she was transferred to the medical intensive care unit for monitoring. patient remained stable both hemodynamically and hematocritwise, and then was transferred to the oncology service for further management. while on the floor patient was again in atrial fibrillation, though she was continued on her diltiazem, and then digoxin was added at the request of her primary cardiologist, dr. last name stitle . following that patients rate was maintained between the 80s and 100. at that point she was taken off telemetry since she was asymptomatic, though persisted in irregular rhythm. once transferred to the oncology service, patient went for a third attempt at a right percutaneous nephrostomy placement. this was done successfully, but the day following the procedure the patient was noted to be hypotensive in the 70s though mentating. blood was also noted in the nephrostomy tube. based on the hypotension and the concern for retroperitoneal bleed, patient was transferred to the funard intensive care unit for further monitoring. while in the intensive care unit,, patient was transferred two units of blood and 10 liters of colloid. once she remained hemodynamically stable with her blood pressures ranging in the high 80s to low 90s patient received a ct of the abdomen to evaluate the level of retroperitoneal bleed. there was no evidence of bleed, except for a clot in the renal pelvis on the right. interventional radiology and urology determined that it would not be wise to go in for another procedure but to just monitor the patient. patient continued to have occasional hematocrit drops though nothing acute. she was transfused to maintain a hematocrit of greater than 30 due to her history of coronary artery disease and an inferior myocardial infarction. to further evaluate the stent, the patient underwent a nephrostogram, which showed patency of the stent, though continued clot which they felt was dissolving and the cause of the dark blood in the nephrostomy tube. since patient continued to have blood in the tube, on 82 interventional radiology performed an angiogram to evaluate for active bleeding. there was no evidence of active bleeding, but a thin walled arteriovenous malformation was noted, though to prevent further rupture, it was determined that interventional radiology would embolize it. this was performed without complication. patients hematocrit was monitored following this procedure, she was again transfused to keep her hematocrit greater than 30. once her hematocrit was determined to be stable the patient was deemed safe to discharge from the interventional radiology standpoint. they requested that she follow up approximately one week post discharge for a repeat nephrogram and an intended internalization of the nephrostomy. of note, while the patient was here, initial urinalysis was positive for e. coli which she was treated for a full course of ciprofloxacin for ten days. this finished, and she had a fever again. she was recultured and again started on cipro briefly for a total of 14 days. follow up urinalysis showed no bacteria but did have 10,000 to 100,000 yeast, though she was treated with diflucan. patients acute renal failure remained relatively stable in the low 2s throughout the course of her stay, this was followed closely in the setting of both her urinary tract infections with multiple manipulations but interventional radiology. patient remained anemic during this stay but goal hematocrit remained greater than 30 in the setting of her coronary artery disease. the persistent drop was thought to be due to the hematoma around the nephrostomy as well as the clot in the renal pelvis. there was no evidence of active bleeding that was persisting. with the hematocrit stable patient was deemed safe to discharge. from her oncology standpoint chemotherapy was not initiated during this stay while acute issues were flaring. her hypothyroidism was not an active issue and she was maintained on her synthroid. patient continued to be noted to be orthostatic while she was here, but since she had a history it was determined that her baseline blood pressure was in the low 90s, and she would occasionally drop to the 80s, but she continued to mentate and felt fine. no further fluid was given to her due to her extensive edema. coronary artery disease she was continued on her lipitor, but her aspirin was held due to the bleeding and the multiple interventions. we will continue to hold the aspirin at her discharge due to the planned nephrogram and potential internalization of the nephrostomy. her electrolytes remained stable, and she was continued on a cardiac diet except for the times that she was

aortitis and aortic valve endocarditis. cultures were negative. of note, a temporal artery biopsy was neagative. an echo ultimately revealed aortic valve endocarditis and aortic insufficiency with a bicuspid aortic valve. since that time he has been followed with serial echocardiograms. his most recent shows a markedly dilated aortic root and ascending aorta with mild aortic stenosis and moderate aortic insufficiency. he has noted progressive dyspnea on exertion as well as fatigue over the past several months. given the progression of his disease, he has been referred back for surgical

differential diagnosis was very broad in this frail patient with several medical conditions, including intracraneal process, systemic infection, delirium, etc. at presentation, given xray findings this was felt to most likely represent hospital acquired pneumonia. patient was initiated on vancomycin, add zosyn and azithromycin for atypical coverage. cultures were obtained and after very prompt improvement, antibiotic regimen was narrowed. after no evidence of infection was found, antibiotics were discontinued and the patient continued to improve. it appears this episode of altered mental status and somnolence was not far from his baseline, currently there is no evidence of systemic infection. hypotension on admission, concern for sepsis physiology, although as above no signs of infection at this time. patient also evaluated for adrenal insufficiency, with a normal cosyntropin stimulation response. patient placed back on midodrine at time of discharge, tolerating dialysis

with htn, seizure do, who presented with speech difficultynew bilateral hand tremors and c. diff colitis. in brief, he had a micu stay for hematemesis and arf with rising wbc. he abdomen continued to be distended and he continued to have copious diarrhea. it was determined that his c.diff infection was so severe he would require colectomy but his family did not want to put the patient through surgery. after much discussion with the micu attending dr. last name stitle , the family decided to make the patient dnrdni and keep only minimal support with antibiotics. upon transfer to the floor, the family, including his son the hcp, the patients wife and daughter in law, decided to pursue comfort measures only around 10pm. the antibiotics and ivf were discontinued. the patient was maintained on morphine for pain control. he expired around 1am. his hospital course is described below by problem list.  c diff found positive at osh, likely secondary to recent antibiotics used for treating pneumonia. wbc count began to rise day after admission, with low grade fevers, and increase abdominal distension. pt had a ct abd scan which showed thickened loops of bowel consistent with the given history of colitis. vancomycin po was added to flagyl as pt was not clinically improving after couple of days on flagyl alone. pt had decrease po intake and was encouraged to drink more fluids and was aggressively hydrated. he was transferred to the icu for hematemesis and arf and in the unit his white count continued to rise and he continued to have signs of colitis. he was treated with flagyl, popr vancomycin, cholestyramine and zosyn. his studies lacked signs of ileus, though he was noted to have distention and trouble with tube feeds so he was kept npo and followed by gi. he had daily kub to monitor for toxic megacolon.  hematemesis new onset coffeeground emesis with likely aspiration of contents. ngt placed and suctioned 1l dark brown material. pt hemodynamically stable, hct 42. transferred to icu for monitoring. he had his hematocrit checked frequently, was given ivf and remained stable and never required blood products. gi followed the patient and an endoscopy was not done. he remained npo for aspiration risks.  aspiration pneumonia new ll lobe infiltrate with likley aspiration noted. already on broad coverage with zosyn, but concern that patient may be becoming septic with hypothermia and increased wbc count, given this the patient was kept on zosyn and vancomycin was added. he was kept npo as well.  dysarthria unclear duration of speech difficulty per history. possibly due to underlying delirium secondary to new cdiff infection. unlikely to be tia or stroke given negative head imaging post fall and no other focal neurological deficits, absence of signs concerning neighboring brainstem dysfunction. extraaxial mass not in location to be contributing to speech difficulty as not in brocas area and no evidence of mass effect on brain parenchyma region involved in facial, tongue motor function. cannot exclude toxicmetabolic etiologies given underlying infection and renal failure.  intention tremor also of unknown duration. not on medications that would cause tremors. no electrolye abnormalities. calcium low but within normal when corrected for albumin. he has family hx of essential tremors and is currently on beta blocker for heart disease. thyroid panel was normal.  intracranial mass found incidentally on head imaging upon admission. most likely meningioma based on ct and mri. neurosurgery eval pt on admission and no intervention was recommended, with suggested followup in 3 month with dr. last name stitle  at hospital1 18 and a repeat mri head at that time.  htn the patient was normotensive, though in the icu his betablocker was held given his hematemesis.  seizure do does not seem to be cause of fall as it appears to be mechanical with lack of postictal state and no loss of consciousness. continued on phenobarb and gapabentin, without epileptic activity during hospital course. prior to transfer out of the icu his gabapentin was held given his renal failure.  arf baseline cr 1.2 and increased to 1.8 on day 2 of hospital course. most likely in the setting of infection and diarrhea. ua negative for uti. he was aggressively hydrated, but given his diarrhea, his renal failure continued to worsen. the family did not want dialysis, so hydration was continued and nephrotoxins were held. medications on admission toprol xl 50mg qd milk of mag neurontin tylenol prilosec, phenobarbitol triamterenehctz 5025 qd
